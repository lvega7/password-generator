# password-generator

In this project, I took the code given to me and added JavaScript to create a responsive password generator. 

I created alerts and prompts that help the user choose how many characters they want their password to be and whether or not to include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, or special characters. 

If they do not choose between 8-128 characters, the page alerts them. If they do not choose at least one character type, the page alerst them.
